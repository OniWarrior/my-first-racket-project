# my-first-racket-project
This is my first project in racket for a homework assignment at University of Texas at Dallas

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: This project consists of a series of functions written in Racket. The purpose is just isn't to
do serious work in Racket, it's just to learn general stuff like defining functions, variables, etc.
