 Desc  : This is my programming project
 written in Racket.
 It consists of a series of functions that
 perform their own individual tasks.

#| Divisible-by-x? function: Take an integer and determine if
   it can evenly divided by x
 |#

 (define divisible-by-x? 
    (Î» (x)
      ( if (zero? (modulo x 2))
        #t
      "Not evenly divisible")))

#| Here's the function call with the example x that should evaluate to true|#
(divisible-by-x? 10)

#| Here's the function call with the example x that should evaluate to false  |#
(divisible-by-x? 11)
